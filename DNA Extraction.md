## DNA Extraction using Quick Extract

### Equipment List
Lab coat  
Nitrile or latex gloves  
Quick Extract  
0.2ul tubes/strips  
MiniPCR (or Heatblocks)  
Marker pen  
Samples to extract  
Scalpel   
Tweezers/foreceps  
0.2ul tube rack  
1.5ml tube rack  
Blue roll  
P20 pipette
Cleaning spray
Spinner *if possible* 

### Methodology

1. Have your samples for extraction ready in front of you.

2. Place tubes or a strip of tubes into a 0.2ul tube rack. Label the lids of each tube with a unique sample ID.   
*You can label the samples using your initials. E.g. HRP1, HRP2, HRP3, HRP4, HRP5, HRP6, HRP7, HRP8*

3. Pipette 10ul of QuickExtract into each tube. 

4. Place a square of blue roll on the lab bench along with cleaning spray and tweezers/foreceps.

5. Using tweezers/foreceps remove one sample to be extracted and place this on the blue roll. This will help to remove any excess ethanol/isopropanol.

6. Make a note of which sample you are extracting and what you think the sample may be.   
*Taking photographs can also be useful.*

7a. **If your sample is small:** Using tweezers/foreceps pick up the sample and place it into the first 0.2ul tube (e.g.HRP1) containaing QuickExtract. Press down firmly to close the lid. Clean the tweeezers/foreceps before moving to the next sample.  

7b. **If your sample is large:** Using a scalpel remove a small piece of the sample (e.g. a leg) and place it into the first 0.2ul tube (e.g.HRP1) containaing QuickExtract. Press down firmly to close the lid. Clean the tweezers/foreceps and carefully clean the scalpel before moving to the next sample.   

8. Repeat this until all eight tubes have sample placed in them. Check that all the 0.2ul tube lids have been closed tighly.  

9. Ensure liquid is at the bottom of the tubes by either gently tapping the tubes on the lab bench or using a spinner.

10. Place tubes firmly into the MiniPCR and secure the MiniPCR lid.

11. Run the MiniPCR using the following program: 65°C for 15 min  
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; 98°C for 2 min

12. Once the MiniPCR program has finished remove the tubes/strip from the MiniPCR and place onto a 0.2ul tube rack.

13. Ensure liquid is at the bottom of the tubes by either gently tapping the tubes on the lab bench or using a spinner.

14. Place a new peice of blue roll on the lab bench. Open the lid of the first tube. 

15. Using tweezers/foreceps carefully remove the sample from the tube and gently press the sample against the tube wall to remove as much liquid as possible without crushing the sample. 

16. Place the sample onto the blue roll. The sample can either be disgarded or it can be placed into a new sample tube for storage and morphological identification.
*If keeping the sample label the tube with information so you can match the sample back to the DNA extraction. E.g. Sample for DNA Extraction HRP1)*

17. Close the sample tube lid and clean the tweezers/foreceps before moving to the next sample. Repeat this until all samples have been removed from the PCR tubes.

18. Your samples now have their DNA extracted! Samples can either be used for PCR immediately or stored in the fridge (~4°C) for up to a week, -20°C freezer for three months, or -70°C freezer indefinetly.
