## 09:30 - DNA Extractions

### Equipment List
Lab coat  
Nitrile or latex gloves  
Quick Extract  
0.2ul tubes/strips  
MiniPCR (or Heatblocks)  
Marker pen  
Samples to extract  
Scalpel   
Tweezers/foreceps  
0.2ul tube rack  
1.5ml tube rack  
Blue roll  
P20 pipette  
Cleaning spray  
Spinner *if possible*   

### Methodology

1. Have your samples for extraction ready in front of you.

2. Place tubes or a strip of tubes into a 0.2ul tube rack. Label the lids of each tube with a unique sample ID.   
*You can label the samples using your initials. E.g. HRP1, HRP2, HRP3, HRP4, HRP5, HRP6, HRP7, HRP8*

3. Pipette 10ul of QuickExtract into each tube. 

4. Place a square of blue roll on the lab bench along with cleaning spray and tweezers/foreceps.

5. Using tweezers/foreceps remove one sample to be extracted and place this on the blue roll. This will help to remove any excess ethanol/isopropanol.

6. Make a note of which sample you are extracting and what you think the sample may be.   
*Taking photographs can also be useful.*

7a. **If your sample is small:** Using tweezers/foreceps pick up the sample and place it into the first 0.2ul tube (e.g.HRP1) containaing QuickExtract. Press down firmly to close the lid. Clean the tweeezers/foreceps before moving to the next sample.  

7b. **If your sample is large:** Using a scalpel remove a small piece of the sample (e.g. a leg) and place it into the first 0.2ul tube (e.g.HRP1) containaing QuickExtract. Press down firmly to close the lid. Clean the tweezers/foreceps and carefully clean the scalpel before moving to the next sample.   

8. Repeat this until all eight tubes have sample placed in them. Check that all the 0.2ul tube lids have been closed tighly.  

9. Ensure liquid is at the bottom of the tubes by either gently tapping the tubes on the lab bench or using a spinner.

10. Place tubes firmly into the MiniPCR and secure the MiniPCR lid.

11. Run the MiniPCR using the following program: 65°C for 15 min  
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; 98°C for 2 min

12. Once the MiniPCR program has finished remove the tubes/strip from the MiniPCR and place onto a 0.2ul tube rack.

13. Ensure liquid is at the bottom of the tubes by either gently tapping the tubes on the lab bench or using a spinner.

14. Place a new peice of blue roll on the lab bench. Open the lid of the first tube. 

15. Using tweezers/foreceps carefully remove the sample from the tube and gently press the sample against the tube wall to remove as much liquid as possible without crushing the sample. 

16. Place the sample onto the blue roll. The sample can either be disgarded or it can be placed into a new sample tube for storage and morphological identification.
*If keeping the sample label the tube with information so you can match the sample back to the DNA extraction. E.g. Sample for DNA Extraction HRP1)*

17. Close the sample tube lid and clean the tweezers/foreceps before moving to the next sample. Repeat this until all samples have been removed from the PCR tubes.

18. Your samples now have their DNA extracted! Place samples in the fridge for storage for the PCR protocol this afternoon.

# *12:00 - Lunch break (1 hr)*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; how to undertake a PCR  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; underlying concepts to gel electrophoresis  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; how to identify (un)successful PCR

### Methodology

1. Retrieve your samples from the fridge. 

2. Defrost the following reagents: PCR mastermix, forward primer, reverse primer, H20, BSA.

3. Label 8 PCR tubes/strips for your PCR reactions. Name these something you can remember and record which DNA sample will go into each tube.
*For a DNA sample named HRP1 I might name the tube HRP PCR1. I will write in my notebook HRP PCR1 = sample ID HRP1*

4. Open a 1.5ml (or equivelant) tube for your mastermix. Label this tube MM (for MasterMix).

5. Set up a mastermix for the nummber of samples you want to PCR (here 8) plus an additional 1 or 2 samples. Here we will set up a mastermix for 10 reactions. 
Set up a master mix as follows: PCR mastermix 5ul
Forward primer   1ul  
Reverse primer   1ul
H20  1.5ul
BSA  0.5ul

6. Thoroughly mix your mastermix (MM) by slowly pipetting the mixture up and down in the tube. 

7. Pipette 9ul of your mastermix (MM) into each 0.2ul tube/strip. You can use the same pipette tip for each tube as the contents are the same.

8. Pipette 1ul of DNA sample into tube one. Disgard the pipette tip after use and tighly close the lid of the PCR tube/strip. 

9. Repeat this for the next six samples into the next six tubes ensuring you use a clean pipette tip each time. 

10. In the last PCR tube we will not add any DNA as this is our negative control. Ensure the lids of all PCR tubes/strips are tightly closed. 

11. Ensre all liquid is at the bottom of the tubes by gently tapping on the desk or by spinning the tubes. 

12. Place the PCR tubes/strip into the MiniPCR and secure the lid. 

13. Start the following MiniPCR programme: 95°C for 5 min
                                           95°C for 30 sec <--- 
                                           50°C for 30 sec    ^ 35x
                                           72°C for 30 sec ---> 
                                           72°C for 10 sec

14. One the PCR has finished open the MiniPCR lid and remove your tubes/strip. Place these on a 0.2ul rack. Samples are ready for loading on a gel or they can be stored in a fridge (~4°C). 

15. Set up the gel moulds and place the combs into position.

16. Measure 50ml of TAE and place into a concicle flask.

17. Add two agarose tablets into the conicle flask. Allow the tablets to fully disolve by carefully swirling the flask periodically.

18a. **Using a microwave:** Once the tablets have dissolved place the conicle flask into a microwave for 30 seconds. Using an oven glove pick up and carefully swirl the glass. Return the flask to the microwave for a further 10-20 seconds before checking if the agarose has completely dissolved. 

18b. **Using a hotplate:** Once the tablets have dissolved place the conicle flask onto a hotplate. Using an oven glove pick up and carefully swirl the glass. Continue heating and swirling until the agarose has completelt dissolved.

19. Allow the hot agarose mixture to cool by either placing on the bench or running the outside of the glass under a cold tap.

20. Once the agarose mixture has cooled add 1ul of gelred stain into the conicle flask and carefully swirl to mix.

21. Once the die has been mixed carefully pour the liquid into the gel moulds.
*Don't take too long to pour the liquid as it will start setting quickly*

22. Allow the gels to cool completely before carefull removing the combs. Pick the gel up by its cradle and place into the gel rig.

23. Cover the gel with 30ml TAE solution. 

24. Prepare stain for your PCR products by covering a 0.2ul tube rack with tin foil.

25. Pipette 3ul of loading dye into a well on the tin foil covered tube rack. Load dye into 8 seperate wells.

26. Pipette 1ul of ladder into the first well of the gel.

27. Open the lid of the first PCR product tube (e.g. HRP1) and pipette Xul of the product into the first well with loading dye. Using the pipette slowly mix the PCR product with the loading dye before pipetting 3ul of the mixture into the second well of the gel.

28. Repeat this for all your PCR products including your negative control. 

29. Place the lid onto the gel rig and turn on the electricity. Place your remaining PCR products back into a fridge for storage.

30. After 30 minutes our gel should be complete so turn off the power.

31. Turn on the light to view your PCR products. If it is difficult to see place the dark box over the gel rig.

32. Document the results by taking a photograph of your gel and/or noting down which wells had product in them.

33. Clean and tidy away all equipment. Ensure PCR products are stored in the fridge for sequencing on Day 3 of the course.


## 17:00 - PCR products stored and lab clean up  
    
Once PCR products have been stored and the lab has been cleaned up students are free to leave. 
Please complete a feedback form for Day 2 of the course.  

*The third day of the course will start on Monday 20th February.*
